## 🌸 About Me  

I’m a **software engineering student** at the *National University of Mongolia* who enjoys building **thoughtful, well-crafted digital products**. I care deeply about **clean architecture, performance, and user experience**—because good software should feel effortless to use.  

My main focus is **backend development with Spring Boot**, paired with **modern, responsive interfaces** using `React` and `Tailwind CSS`. I enjoy designing systems that are not only reliable and scalable, but also pleasant for users and developers alike.  

Recently, I’ve been exploring **game development and 3D design**, combining logic with creativity through tools like `Blender`, `Unity`, `Godot`, and `Phaser.js`. I love turning abstract ideas into interactive experiences.  

At the moment, I’m working on an **e-commerce platform** with a strong emphasis on **performance, usability, and elegant UI design**. My long-term goal is to create software that feels intuitive, polished, and genuinely enjoyable.  

Outside of coding, I’m an **INTJ** who enjoys **digital art, visual design, and emerging technologies**—always learning, always refining.
